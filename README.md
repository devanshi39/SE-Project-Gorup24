## What is Evolo?
Evolo is Dashboard based Project Management System. A complete solution for group projects in organizations that lets you track your work in any scenario. Working in a team is a cumbersome task, ease it using our project management system. Add statuses, comments, and attachments to make sure you have all the correct information to get your work done!
Manage your team on this one platform having variety of features:
 - Assign them tasks on this platform, with a deadline.
 - Add or Remove team members in the middle of the project, conflict free from redundant or missing tasks.
 - All the members will be reminded about the deadline periodically, even requests can be made to team leader for deadline extension.
 - Team members can submit their task using this platform too.
 - Submitted tasks can be checked and reviews can be directly conveyed to the team members using this platform.

Evolo users can be divided into two types:
 - Project administrators: 
 Project administrators are responsible for configuring their projects. They can administer projects, change the look and feel, and make various configuration changes to the project.

 - Users:
 Users are responsible for working in specific JIRA Core projects. Users are given access to a project's issues and, depending on their permissions, work on the issue by commenting on it, transitioning it through its workflow and closing it when complete.
