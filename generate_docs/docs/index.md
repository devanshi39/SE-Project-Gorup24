Evolo users can be divided into two types:

 Project administrators are responsible for configuring their projects. They can administer projects, change the look and feel, and make various configuration changes to the project.

 - Users:
 Users are responsible for working in specific JIRA Core projects. Users are given access to a project's issues and, depending on their permissions, work on the issue by commenting on it, transitioning it through its workflow and closing it when complete.
